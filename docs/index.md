# [Bioinformatics Notebook](https://github.com/GiangLeN/Zymo-Mock-sequencing.git)

by [Ngoc Giang Le](https://github.com/GiangLeN)


This project shows how to build pipeline to analyze the publicly available sequencing data of the zymoBIOMICS Mock community. Different tools and approaches will be used for comparison. Codes, and scripts are also provided to tie various tools together. It is possible to view this documents locally or online at <https://gianglen.github.io/Zymo-Mock-sequencing/>.

Spot any mistakes or have questions, [please submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/GiangLeN/Zymo-Mock-sequencing/issues).

This tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge about the command lines and anaconda. If you want me to cover these topics please submit an issue on GitHub.
