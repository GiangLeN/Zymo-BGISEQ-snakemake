Introduction
The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) are two of the largest public repositories of high-throughput sequencing data. To access this data, there are various tools available, including SRA-Tools and Kingfisher. In this tutorial, we will compare these two tools and show you how to use them to download sequencing data from ENA and SRA.

Installing the tools
Both Kingfisher and SRA-Tools can be installed using the conda package manager. Here are the installation commands:

Installing Kingfisher
bash
Copy code
conda install -c bioconda kingfisher
Installing SRA-Tools
bash
Copy code
conda install -c bioconda sra-tools
Downloading data from ENA
Using Kingfisher
To download data from ENA using Kingfisher, you need to provide a list of accessions in a text file. Here's an example of how to download two sequencing runs from ENA:

Create a file ena_accessions.txt with the following content:
Copy code
ERR4584932
ERR4584933
Use Kingfisher to download the data:
bash
Copy code
kingfisher ena download -i ena_accessions.txt -o ena_data
This command will download the data to a directory called ena_data.

Using SRA-Tools
To download data from ENA using SRA-Tools, you need to use the fastq-dump command. Here's an example of how to download two sequencing runs from ENA:

bash
Copy code
fastq-dump --split-files ERR4584932 ERR4584933 --outdir sra_data
This command will download the data to a directory called sra_data.

Downloading data from SRA
Using Kingfisher
To download data from SRA using Kingfisher, you need to provide a list of accessions in a text file. Here's an example of how to download two sequencing runs from SRA:

Create a file sra_accessions.txt with the following content:
Copy code
SRR10903401
SRR10903402
Use Kingfisher to download the data:
bash
Copy code
kingfisher sra download -i sra_accessions.txt -o sra_data
This command will download the data to a directory called sra_data.

Using SRA-Tools
To download data from SRA using SRA-Tools, you need to use the fastq-dump command. Here's an example of how to download two sequencing runs from SRA:

bash
Copy code
fastq-dump --split-files SRR10903401 SRR10903402 --outdir sra_data
This command will download the data to a directory called sra_data.

Comparison of the tools
Both Kingfisher and SRA-Tools are capable of downloading data from ENA and SRA, and both tools are relatively easy to use. However, there are some differences to consider when choosing which tool to use:

Kingfisher
Supports multiple data sources including ENA and SRA
Can download data in parallel
Provides a progress bar during downloads
Supports resuming failed downloads
SRA-Tools
Specifically designed for downloading data from SRA
Provides various options for downloading data (e.g., compressed vs uncompressed)
Can download data in parallel
Supports resuming
